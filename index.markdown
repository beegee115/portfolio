# Professional portfolio

I'm happy and humbled that you're taking this time to review my writing samples.

I've curated some of my favourite pieces below.
They are grouped by employer (newest first) and type.


## Developer onboarding (Fullscript)

I was contracted by Fullscript to build a developer onboarding experience.
The identified **target audience was a junior software developer**.
Here is a small sample from the work I did with Fullscript.

## API documentation (You.i TV)

While I was at You.i TV, we consciously moved our developer documentation to an `open-source` and `docs-as-code` model.
As a result of this transformation, we changed our authoring stack from `MadCap Flare` to `Markdown` processed with `Jekyll`.

The **primary audience** for our documentation was a **junior to mid-level React Native developers** and **senior C++ developers**.

Note: Like many software organizations, You.i TV had a collaborative team of writers who updated API documentation from release to release. 
Therefore, few pages of content can be uniquely attributed to one author.
With that in mind, I chose the above samples because I was the original author and developer liaison for these topics.

## Developer quickstart guide (You.i TV)

As a precursor to You.i TV's open-source documentation model, I volunteered to evaluate the tech stack by using it to implement our new developer onboarding guide.
This first project with `Jekyll` and `Markdown` was very successful.

## Product and company messaging (Ario)

As employee #7 of a new fintech startup, I took on whatever needed to be done.
That meant a lot of really interesting writing opportunities. 

Unfortunately, I can't share the policy documents I helped write, or the UX design and interaction text that I developed.
However, I can share this work on our website, where I collaborated closely with our co-founders and HR team on initial product and company positioning. In addition to the content writing, I was also responsible for the info graphics and artwork.
(I'm not an graphics designer, but I selected and modified stock graphics used.)

## Web help (Epiphan Video)

When Epiphan released the Webcaster X2, we knew we needed a new type of online help. 
This product was positioned very differently from the rest of our product line, and was **targeted for creators and influencers**. 
I built a new, modern output style for publishing our guide from `MadCap Flare`. 

As part of this build, I devised a way to improve the basic Flare menus. 
MadCap **asked if they could publish my write up** on the topic. 
Read it below.

## User guide and product messaging (Epiphan Video)

I was the primary author of the initial Epiphan Pearl product page and user guide.
The user guide was targeted towards **proficient video technicians**.
Authoring was done in `MadCap Flare` with output to both `PDF` and `HTML`.

## Media articles and white papers

A variety of technical levels and audiences were served by Epiphan's downloadable brochures and ads in technical journals.
Presented below are two examples of articles I wrote:
 
* a case study done in conjunction with the Harvard Division of Continuing Education
* a paid industry spot (styled to look like a regular article)

## Press releases and ghostwriting

The writing team at Epiphan wrote a bit of everything. 
Find below three examples from my time there:

 * a new product press release
 * an industry article written after a chat with the CEO
 * a blog post written with a colleague
